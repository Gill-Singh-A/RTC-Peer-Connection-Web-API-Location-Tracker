# Omegle Tracker
A JavaScript Program that gets the IP Address of the connected device using RTCPeerConnection Web API and getting its Geological Information  using IPGeolocation's API.
## Usage
Open Console in your Browser and Paste the code written in **omegle_tracker.js**
## Output
It displays the Geological Information about the IP Address's Location that it got from IPGeolocation's API in the console.
### Note 
* The location might not be correct
* It is just a program that displays the data that it got from the database of the given service.
* And it is also not live tracking of a device.
* You must replace **YOUR_API_KEY** on line 1 with your api key that you got from [IP Geolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/)

This also proves that how insecure it is to use Omegle without any Proxy or VPN.<br />
Although there are limited things that someone can do by getting the IP Address of a device, but still it gives a step forward.
